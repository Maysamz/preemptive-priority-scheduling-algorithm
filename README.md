# preemptive-priority-scheduling-algorithm
This program involve implementing a preemptive priority-scheduling algorithm, which schedules
processes in order of priority and uses FCFS scheduling for processes with the same priority. Priorities
range from 1 to 5, where a lower numeric value indicates a higher relative priority. Assume the overhead
of the Context Switch (CS) is 1 ms.
- our program shows the following menu:
1. Enter processâ€™ information.
2. Report detailed information about each process and different scheduling criteria.
3. Exit the program
